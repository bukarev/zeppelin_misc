Spark_ML_train_movement_modes
Full scenario described here: https://mapr.com/blog/cool-fitness-tracker-using-iot-sensors-cloud-ml-on-mapr/

Uses Spark to ingest saved IoT movement data (linear and angle accelerations) and train a ML model that would classify a movement mode between standing/walking/jumping. Saves the model for use in a streaming Spark application.
